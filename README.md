# The money language

Absolutely no good reason for calling it `money`. I just needed a name for the
project and I saw a $20 bill on my desk.

## There are already so many JVM languages, why create another one?

1. Because I can

2. Because creating a language where I can do absolutely anything I want is
   a power move

3. Because it's really fun

## Goals

1. Create a working JVM (toy) language using the class file API.

2. Variable declarations, function calls, function declaration, basic
   arithmetic, and control flow operation such as if statements and loops.
